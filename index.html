        <h2 id="wit">What are they?</h2>
        <p class="texto">
            An NFT game is a video game where some of its parts are NFT. Usually the characters, but it can also be the weapons, the house where you live, the household objects, the vehicles, etc.That is, you buy with money that NFT, and it is unique within the game. There can be millions of characters or weapons, but each one has something unique and cannot be copied or counterfeited, because it is encrypted within a blockchain or blockchain, usually Ethereum's.

        <h2 id="hw">How do they work?</h2>
        <p class="texto">The simple answer is that NFT games allow users to earn money as they play. Blending video games with finance, or GameFi as players call it, these games use NFTs (unique digital collectibles on the blockchain) that gamers can sell in games to other collectors and players. Gamers can also earn NFTs in certain pay-to-earn gaming models. This setup allows gamers to invest in NFTs, which have the potential to appreciate in value.</p>

        <h2 id="pr">FAQs About NFT Games</h2>
        <li class="faq">How to enter the gaming space?</li>
        <p class="texto">The new crypto paradigm allows players to invest time and /or money in securing NFT<br>
        items within the game. You keep these items in your inventory or your NFT wallet, and as<br>
        more people join the game, the demand for these items increases and you can sell them<br>
        again for real currency. With gamers playing games on mobiles, consoles, and PCs both<br>
        online and offline, the revenue generated from these NFTs goes towards funding the<br>
        game’s play-to-earn feature.<br>
        </p>
        <li class="faq">What are Crypto wallets?</li>
        <p class="texto">
            A crypto wallet is a place where you can keep your crypto assets safe. There are many<br>
            different types of crypto wallets, however, the most popular are hosted wallets, non-<br>
            custody wallets, and hardware wallets.<br>
        </p>
        <li class="faq">What are in-game transactions?</li>
        <p class="texto">
            In-game transactions refer to items or points that a player can purchase to use in the<br>
            virtual world to improve a character or enhance the playing experience. These in-game<br>
            purchases are the primary means by which free-to-play games generate revenue for their<br>
            creators.<br>
